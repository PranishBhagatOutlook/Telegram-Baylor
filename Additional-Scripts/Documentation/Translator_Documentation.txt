This is a Python script that reads a CSV file named "messages.csv" using the pandas library. 
It creates an instance of the Googletrans Translator class and defines a function named "translate_message" that takes a message and returns its translation to English if it is not already in English. 
The script then applies this function to the "message" column of the data frame and stores the translated messages in a new column named "translated_message". 
Finally, it saves the modified data frame to a new CSV file named "translated_messages.csv" using the to_csv() function.
