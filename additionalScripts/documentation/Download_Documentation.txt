This program downloads media content from a list of links provided in a CSV file. 
It first asks the user to enter the name of the CSV file and then creates a directory with the same name (without the file extension). 
It then reads the CSV file and extracts the links, and then downloads the media from each link and saves it in the created directory.

The program uses the csv and requests modules in Python. 
The os module is also used to create a directory with the same name as the CSV file.

The program loops through each link and downloads its media content. 
The media is saved with a unique filename, which consists of the index of the link in the list and the file extension of the media content.

After all media files have been downloaded, the program prints "Download complete." to indicate that the download process has finished.
