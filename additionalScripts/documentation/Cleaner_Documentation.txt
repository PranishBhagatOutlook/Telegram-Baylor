Cleaner.py Documentation
The cleaner.py script processes a CSV file with raw channel messages and performs several data cleaning and transformation operations on it. The resulting cleaned and transformed data is then saved to a new CSV file.
The script uses the pandas library to read the raw CSV file into a DataFrame. It then applies the following cleaning and transformation operations:
  1.	Extract the channel ID from the peer_id column.
  2.	Extract information from the from_id and media columns into separate columns.
  3.	Extract information from the entities, reply_to, and replies columns into separate columns.
  4.	Strip the sizes, replies, entities, and reply_to columns from the DataFrame.
  5.	Extract information from the sizes column into separate columns.
  6.	Finally, the cleaned and transformed DataFrame is saved to a new CSV file.
It is important to note that the script assumes that the input CSV file has a specific structure and format. If the input file has a different structure, the script may not work correctly.
Note file encoding must be UTF-8
